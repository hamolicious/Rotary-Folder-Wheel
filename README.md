# Rotary-Folder-Wheel
**WINDOWS ONLY**<br>
A rotary wheel "folder" written in Python 3 and PyGame, allows you to change the appearance of an actively accessed folder, in the demo I attached it to my PythonTools folder, in there, I keep all of the tools I write using python, then I can easily and quickly access them. The Folder that I opened is just a shortcut to the main.pyw file with a changed icon. I suggest to use the ```pythonw.exe``` compiler to run the pyw file as this allows it to run without the console.

<br>
Use left click to select the tool you want or use right click to exit the folder.
